# Semi Supervised Learning Of Classifiers

There has been increasing attention to semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches in machine learning to forming a classifier in situations where the training data for a classifier consists of a limited number of classified observations but a much larger
number of unclassified observations. This is because the procurement of classified
data can be quite costly due to high acquisition costs and subsequent financial, time,
and ethical issues that can arise in attempts to provide the true class labels for the
unclassified data that have been acquired. We provide here a review of statistical SSL approaches to
this problem, focussing on the recent result that a classifier formed from a partially
classified sample can actually have smaller expected error rate than that if the
sample were completely classified. This rather paradoxical outcome is able to be
achieved by introducing a framework with a missingness mechanism for the missing
labels of the unclassified observations. It is most relevant in commonly occurring
situations in practice, where the unclassified data occur primarily in regions of relatively
high entropy in the feature space thereby making it difficult for their class labels to be
easily obtained.
